About:

This mod was created by Nick Brown. I've played the Freespace 2 demo and I really
enjoyed it. However, FS2 is still not available to us over here in Australia yet,
so I have to improvise. I've changed the sounds in FS1 to sound like the new FS2
sounds. Of course, they're not my sounds, I extracted them from the FS2Demo VP
file, but they sound much better than the original FS1 sounds. Have fun...
