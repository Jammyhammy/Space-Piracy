About:

This mod was created by Nick Brown. I'm a huge fan of most Sci Fi programs,
especially Star Trek and Star Wars, so I decided I wanted to change the
sounds of the interface and weapons, etc and make them sound like Star Trek
and Star Wars weapons and interface. I obtained the sounds from www.stinsv.com
and some other sounds from several other websites. I hope you like them.
